# Shane Mindreau's Portfolio

## Description

This project is meant to serve as a portfolio to showcase my skills and talents to employers. Through this project I wish to introduce myself, present a few of my projects to browse, and provide links to my contact information and personal GitHub Repositories.

## Usage

**[`Deployed Portfolio`](https://smindre1.github.io/shane-mindreau-portfolio/)**

## Credits

I sought help from my instructor/TA, and tutor, to better understand flexbox so that I may apply it to my own program.

I learned how to do a 'mailto:' link using:
https://email.uplers.com/blog/best-practices-for-creating-html-email-links/

I learned how to do a 'tel:' link using:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31520894/using-css-classes-to-format-a-hreftel-link

I reffered to the following link in order to properly set up a jump link from my navigation bar:
https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/jump-link-same-page

## Features

1. A menu navigation tag (Sends the user to the corresponding section of the webpage).
2. An about me section with a profile picture and a self summary of myself.
3. A section devoted to my prior projects (each displaying the involved coding languages and titles). Each mockup picture is linked to its corresponding Github repository from my library.
4. A section for my contact information, hyperlinking my phone number, email address, linkden profile, and Github account.
5. The viewport has been made to be addaptive to the window's size and restructured in the event it is viewed on a mobile device.
